How to  automate MySQL database backups in Windows:

1. Create a batch file (ending in .bat ) containing this-

	@ECHO OFF

	set TIMESTAMP=%DATE:~10,4%%DATE:~4,2%%DATE:~7,2%

	"C:\path-to\mysql\bin\mysqldump.exe" --databases database-name1 --result-file="C:\path-to\backup\databases.%TIMESTAMP%.sql" --user=username --password=password

	C:
	CD \path-to\backup\

	MAKECAB "databases.%TIMESTAMP%.sql" "databases.%TIMESTAMP%.sql.cab"
	DEL /q /f "databases.%TIMESTAMP%.sql"


   Note: Don't forget to change the "path-to" (according to the location of files in your PC) in the above commands



2. Create a Task to run this batch file periodically

	Use Task Scheduler (in-built in Windows) to do this.
	
		a. Open Task Scheduler
		b. Right click on Task Scheduler Library on the left pane
		c. Click on Create Task
		d. Fill in all the tabs (General, Triggers, Action, Conditions, Settings). 
		   Here the most important tab is the Action tab, where you'll choose the batch file you created in Step 1.
		e. Now to view your created task, click on Task Scheduler Library.




Tips:  To edit batch files you can use Notepad or Notepad++
       Ensure the MySQL service is running in the Services tab of Task Manager
